"The picture makes the shoe look like it has a ""boxier"" toe rather than the ""pointier"" toe that it actually has. I have wider feet and generally need to buy a size or half size longer to get a comfortable width (in any brand of shoe). I was shooting for a rounder, broader toe design which is more comfortable for me, and I feel that the pictures of this shoe didn't accurately depict what I received, in that one detail.
