I use them for basic workout cardio and cross training, as well as work as a massage therapist (I go through shoes fast enough that Ive recently consolidated).\\nIf you're a Go Walk fan, these do not offer the same level of cushion-comfort as those, HOWEVER, they offer the kind of long-term comfort to make them a durable option.\\nThe material of the shoes seem very durable and the breathable.

But it is the correct amount of room from big toe to edge of shoe for me (an inch or less, I don\\'t want my big toe being jammed into edge of shoe when lunging, jumping, etc.).

I don't think as much as I am on my feet I will be able to wear them an extended amount of time. I will have to rotate wearing them every other day. For normal wear, I believe, people will be fine. I am literally walking or standing six hours a day straight.\\n\\n**UPDATE: So, initially after wearing them, I had hip pain after wearing them.

Breathable, lightweight but sturdy, and comfortable during all my workouts. The built-in arch support is great and I've had no discomfort after 2 weeks of use. As far as the sole thickness and cushioning goes, I would consider these a 'medium' build (not thin, not overly thick) so if you're into heavy running outdoors then take that into consideration.

Breathable, lightweight but sturdy, and comfortable during all my workouts. The built-in arch support is great and I've had no discomfort after 2 weeks of use. As far as the sole thickness and cushioning goes, I would consider these a 'medium' build (not thin, not overly thick) so if you're into heavy running outdoors then take that into consideration.

Breathable, lightweight but sturdy, and comfortable during all my workouts. The built-in arch support is great and I've had no discomfort after 2 weeks of use. As far as the sole thickness and cushioning goes, I would consider these a 'medium' build (not thin, not overly thick) so if you're into heavy running outdoors then take that into consideration.

I could probably tie the laces differently or put in an insole(they\\'re pretty expensive), but as is, when I did a zumba class in these, my arch began to twinge :(\\nHowever, this is overall an awesome shoe that I will continue to stick with for going out, day to day walking, and for training and gym use (with the exception of running and zumba (although hip-hop was fine). The shoes have a great flexibility to them and don\\'t look \"dirty\" easily. My previous pair of flex supreme TR 3s have lasted for a good 2 years and are just now on the verge of being worn out. This is the optimal sneaker that is flexible in more ways than one: from pointing you toes to leg-pressing, from gym use to shopping to adding a sporty edge to a dressy night out, the flex has it all.', \"Love these!

I wore them an entire day the first day and had no problems. The second day; however, I got a pain in my hip to the point where I started limping. As soon as I got home and took them off, the pain was gone the rest of the evening. I'm only 30 by the way. Nothing else in my daily routine changed except wearing these shoes two days in a row. I don't understand why it would make my hip hurt since they are comfortable on my feet, but I'm sure that was the problem. I wore different shoes today and had no pain. I don't think as much as I am on my feet I will be able to wear them an extended amount of time. I will have to rotate wearing them every other day. For normal wear, I believe, people will be fine. I am literally walking or standing six hours a day straight.\\n\\n**UPDATE: So, initially after wearing them, I had hip pain after wearing them. I don't know if they just needed to be broken in, but I wear them all the time now and have not experienced any pain since the first couple times of wearing them.

I've had Nike's before and have always been pleased with the comfort, performance, and quality. Though I will say this was the first time I ordered a pair online without trying them on first, so I was nervous. But this turned out to be a great choice. Breathable, lightweight but sturdy, and comfortable during all my workouts. The built-in arch support is great and I've had no discomfort after 2 weeks of use. As far as the sole thickness and cushioning goes, I would consider these a 'medium' build (not thin, not overly thick) so if you're into heavy running outdoors then take that into consideration. Everyone is different in their preference for cushioning, but I think for light runs on a treadmill they would be sufficient.

this be the first time i order a pair online without try them on first so i be nervous but this turn out to be a great choice breathable lightweight but sturdy and comfortable during all my workout the built-in arch support be great and i've have no discomfort after 2 week of use a far a the sole thickness and cushion go i would consider these a medium build not thin not overly thick so if you're into heavy run outdoors then take that into consideration everyone be different in their preference for cushion but i think for light run on a treadmill they would be sufficient love these highly recommend\", \"the material be real then hope they don't fall apart to expensive for what you get\", 'nice', 'gracias', 'love these shoe they be true to size and very comfortable this be my second pair - i wore out the first pair good arch support - i have a high arch', 'great arch support and comfortable', 'it look a bit nicer on the picture it very light in such a way that when i held

especially that the sole be not bulky like my previous run shoe i hat those thing lol i would give them a shot and they be great for the price', 'great shoe fit perfectly comfortable right from the start light weight and perfect for a 12 hour work shift good price also', 'i love them they fit perfect and be very comfortable', 'love these lightweight shoe absolute favorite always order half a
